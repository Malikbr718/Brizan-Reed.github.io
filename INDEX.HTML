                <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead, located in Brooklyn in the Flatlands neighborhood, is a national historic landmark. The homestead was estimated to be built in 1776 during the American Revolution. 

                It was once a lovely landmark but is now in despair due to stolen antiques, vandalism, and many violations for failure to maintain the homestead and trespassing. However, it has been listed as permanently closed on Google this year. 

                There are about 37,000 landmarks in New York City, and from 2019, this homestead has earned ten violations, the most out of the five boroughs. Since 2014, the average number of violations a landmark receives every four years is two. The data found to discover the violations found for Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead is sourced from NYC OpenData. The data is orginally from the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).

                The historic property once for sale for $5 million is now $4 million and is not the only endangered landmark in the city. Out of around 70 old Dutch houses in New York during the 1950s, only about 10 remain in Brooklyn and a few elsewhere. These include the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Canarsie, which was built before 1652 and was the city's first landmark, as well as the Dyckman Farmhouse in uptown Manhattan from around 1785.

                It's unknown what the future is for this neighborhood eyesore but residents are hoping someone can perserve the history of the homestead.
